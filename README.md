# Hotdog-CoreML
An iOS app used to detect whether the image captured is of Hotdog or not.
I made this app to learn how to import image recoginition model (inceptionv3.mlmodel in this case) into our app and use it for detecting a hotdog in the image captured.


Screenshots from the app:

Hotdog detected:
